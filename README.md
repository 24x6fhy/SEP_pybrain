<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results>

<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>

<Test 2>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Test 1>

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>

<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>
